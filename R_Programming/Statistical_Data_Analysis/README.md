# ðŸ’¬ Overview
Welcome to the "London Bike Sharing Dataset - Statistical Data Analysis" repository! This project aims to perform a comprehensive statistical data analysis of the London bike-sharing dataset, which is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains valuable information about bike trips taken in London, and through our analysis, we seek to gain insights into bike usage patterns, user behavior, and more.

# ðŸš© About the Dataset

It includes information such as trip duration, start and end times, user types, and more. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is made available on Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts.
